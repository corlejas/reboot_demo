    "## Purpose:\n",
    "To briefly discuss the availability of subjective and objective data relationship analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "*LLM's* and *vector* search are great for the subjective assessment of data relationshsips - they identify collections that are symantically **\"alike\"**.  This enables LLM's to be *creative* which is also why they get things wrong.\n",
    "Graph databases, specifically *knowledge graphs*, are wholly objective in their inferences through the data relationships.  Wikidata is a graph database that sits behind a large proprtion of wikipedia. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Method:\n",
    "Use *Langchain* to orchestrate GPT-4 to write some code to construct an API call (and query) into Wikidata, to answer a specific questions.  Langchain will the manage the execution of the code, to return the response back to GPT-4 to format the layout.   \n",
